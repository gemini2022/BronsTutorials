                  <li>A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that identifies or names a resource. The main purpose of this identification is to enable VoIP devices to communicate with other devices over a network using specific protocols. URIs are defined in schemes that define a specific syntax and format and the protocols for the call. After you create a UM dial plan, you won't be able to change the URI type without deleting the dial plan, and then re-creating the dial plan to include the correct URI type. You can select one of the following URI types for the dial plan:</li>

For example, if a user associated with a dial plan dials a 4-digit extension to call another user in the same dial plan, select 4 as the number of digits in the extension. The number of digits for extension numbers is based on the telephony dial plan created on a PBX. This is a required field that has a value range from 1 through 20. The typical extension length is from 3 through 7 digits. If your existing telephony environment includes extension numbers, you must specify a number of digits that matches the number of digits in those extensions when you create the UM dial plan.</p>
