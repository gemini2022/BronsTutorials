                  <li>Use this dropdown to select the audio codec that will be used by the dial plan. When a caller places a call to a user who is associated with the dial plan, Unified Messaging uses the audio codec that you select from this list to record voice messages that will be sent to UM-enabled users. By default, the MP3 format is selected. The MP3 format is a common audio file format that's used to greatly reduce the size of the audio file and is most commonly used by personal audio devices or MP3 players. MP3 is a cross-platform type of audio codec and is used for compatibility with many mobile phone and devices and various computer operating systems. WMA is used because it's highly compressed and has high quality format properties. G.711 PCM Linear is a telephone quality audio codec format that's the least compressed and has the lowest quality format. GSM 06.10 is an audio codec format that's used by mobile phone vendors and is the standard for digital mobile phone services. If you're concerned about users' disk quotas, select WMA as the audio codec. Voice files saved in .wma format are approximately half the size of the same voice recording made using one of the other audio codecs. </li>

                  <li>By default, if you install U.S. English with Exchange 2010, only one language is listed in this list. To have other language options available, you must install the UM language pack for each language you want to include. Adding other languages lets subscribers use a language other than U.S. English. For example, if a subscriber calls in to the Unified Messaging system using the subscriber access number from a desk telephone, the subscriber is greeted with a prerecorded operator's voice in English. Even if the same user selects a different language in Outlook Web App, such as French, the menus are still read in U.S. English. For the user to be able to hear the prerecorded operator menus in French, you must install the appropriate language.</li>
