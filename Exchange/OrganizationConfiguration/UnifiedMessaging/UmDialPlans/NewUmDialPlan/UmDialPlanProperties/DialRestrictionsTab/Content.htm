However, they can place a call or transfer a call to extension numbers associated with UM-enabled users. This is because the&nbsp;<strong>Allow calls to users within the same dial plan</strong>&nbsp;setting is enabled by default. The&nbsp;<strong>Allow calls to extensions</strong>&nbsp;setting is disabled by default. When this setting is enabled, users who call in to a subscriber access number configured on the dial plan can place calls to users who aren't UM-enabled, to other extension numbers not associated with a UM-enabled user, and to UM-enabled users. This is because the&nbsp;<strong>Allow calls to users within the same dial plan</strong>&nbsp;setting is enabled by default. You can enable this setting in an environment where not all users have been UM-enabled. This setting is also useful when you want to allow users who call in to a subscriber access number configured on a dial plan to call extension numbers that aren't associated.</p>

In-country/region dialing rule groups are used to allow or restrict the telephone numbers within a country or region that any user who has dialed in to the subscriber access number can dial. This helps prevent unnecessary or unauthorized telephone calls and charges. To add in-country/region dialing rule groups, you must first create the appropriate in-country/region dialing rule groups on the dial plan, and then add the appropriate dialing rule entries on the dialing rule groups. After you create the required dialing rule groups on the dial plan, you must then add the dialing rule groups to the list of dialing restrictions on the&nbsp;<strong>Dialing Restrictions</strong>&nbsp;tab on the dial plan. In-country/region dialing rule groups can be used to enable a Unified Messaging server to allow or restrict access to telephone numbers within a country or region. This is applied to all users who have called in to a subscriber access number.</p>
