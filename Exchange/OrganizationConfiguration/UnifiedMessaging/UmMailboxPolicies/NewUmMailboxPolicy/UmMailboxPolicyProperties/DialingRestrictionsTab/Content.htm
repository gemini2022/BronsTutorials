UM mailbox policies are required to enable users for Unified Messaging. They are useful for applying and standardizing Unified Messaging configuration settings for UM-enabled users. You can create UM mailbox policies to apply a common set of policies or security settings to a collection of UM-enabled mailboxes. You can use these settings to control the extension numbers that can be reached by UM-enabled users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy or to control the telephone numbers that can be dialed by UM-enabled users who are associated with the UM mailbox policy. To learn about the Dialing Restrictions tab, proceed with the following steps...</p></td>

In-country/region dialing rule groups are used to allow or restrict the telephone numbers within a country or region that Outlook Voice Access users can dial. This helps prevent unnecessary or unauthorized telephone calls and charges. To add in-country/region dialing rule groups, you must first create the appropriate in-country/region dialing rule groups on the dial plan associated with the UM mailbox policy, and then add the appropriate dialing rule entries on the dialing rule group. After you create the required dialing rule groups on the dial plan, you must then add the dialing rule groups to the list of dialing restrictions on the&nbsp;<strong>Dialing Restrictions</strong>&nbsp;tab on the UM mailbox policy. In-country/region dialing rule groups can be used to enable a Unified Messaging server to allow or restrict access to telephone numbers within a country or region.
