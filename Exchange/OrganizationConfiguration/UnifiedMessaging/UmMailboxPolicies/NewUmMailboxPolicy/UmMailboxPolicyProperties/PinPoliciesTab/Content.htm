Unified Messaging PINs enable users to access their Inboxes by using a telephone. By configuring settings on this page, you can specify the minimum number of digits for a UM PIN or the number of failed logon attempts before users are locked out of their UM mailbox. Make sure that you plan carefully for the UM PIN policies that you implement in your environment. If you don't plan and implement the appropriate UM PIN policies, you may introduce security threats and mistakenly allow unauthorized access to your network. To learn about the PIN Policies tab, proceed with the following steps...</p></td>

                    <p>Use this text box to specify the minimum number of digits that a UM user's PIN can contain. The default setting is six digits. The range is from 4 through 24 numeric digits. This setting can't be disabled. Increasing the number of digits required for a PIN increases the level of security for your Unified Messaging system. Decreasing the number of digits required for a PIN reduces the level of security for your network. The fewer the digits that are required in a PIN, the easier it is for a potential attacker to guess a user's PIN. If this setting is set too high, users might have problems remembering their PINs. However, if the setting is too low, you risk unauthorized access to the Unified Messaging system.</p>

If the user tries to use the new PIN five more times unsuccessfully, the system will again reset the PIN.

After a user is locked out, an administrator must manually reset or unlock the mailbox for the user. This value can be set from 1 through 999.
