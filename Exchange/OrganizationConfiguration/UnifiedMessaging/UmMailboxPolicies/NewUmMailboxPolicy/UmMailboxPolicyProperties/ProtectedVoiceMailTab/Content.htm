                    <p>Select this check box if you want to force users who receive protected voice messages to use the Play on Phone feature. Or, if the client software doesn't support rights management, users must use Outlook Voice Access. The Play on Phone feature only applies to clients using a version of Outlook that supports rights management. For Outlook 2007 and earlier versions that don't support rights management, and for Outlook Web App clients, Outlook Voice Access is the only way that users can listen to Protected Voice Mail. The default setting requires all users associated with the UM mailbox policy to use the Play on Phone feature to listen to voice messages that are protected. By doing this, it prevents other people from hearing the voice message using a media player over computer speakers or using a media player on a mobile phone to hear the voice message. Even if this is enabled, a UM-enabled user can still use Outlook Voice Access to hear the Protected Voice Mail. This is especially useful when UM-enabled users use public computers, laptops in public places, or their mobile phone's media player to listen to Protected Voice Mail that can contain private information. This option isn't available to UM-enabled users who have a mailbox on an Exchange 2007 Unified Messaging server.</p>
