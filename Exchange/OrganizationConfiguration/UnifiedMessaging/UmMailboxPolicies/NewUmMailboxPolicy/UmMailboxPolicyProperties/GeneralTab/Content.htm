UM mailbox policies let you apply a common set of settings to a collection or group of mailboxes. You must create a UM mailbox policy before you can enable users for Unified Messaging.

Typically, when a user misses an incoming call, the user receives two e-mail messages: an e-mail message that contains the voice mail message and a missed call notification message. By default, missed call notifications are enabled when a UM mailbox policy is created.</p>

If this option is disabled on the UM dial plan, UM-enabled users associated with the UM mailbox policy won't be able to receive faxes. The default setting is disabled. After you have enabled the&nbsp;<strong>Allow inbound faxes</strong>&nbsp;setting, you will need to specify the URI for the partner fax server.
