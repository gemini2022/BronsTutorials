An auto attendant is the collection of voice prompts that callers hear instead of a human operator when they call in to an organization that has Exchange 2010 Unified Messaging. You can use these settings to control the extension numbers that can be reached from an auto attendant or control the telephone numbers that can be dialed by callers that have dialed into the auto attendant.

However, they can place calls or transfer calls to extension numbers associated with UM-enabled users. This is because the&nbsp;<strong>Allow calls to users within the same dial plan</strong>&nbsp;setting is enabled by default. The&nbsp;<strong>Allow calls to extensions</strong>&nbsp;setting is enabled by default. When this setting is enabled, users who call in to an auto attendant can place calls to users who aren't UM-enabled, to other extension numbers not associated with a UM-enabled user, and to UM-enabled users. This is because the&nbsp;<strong>Allow calls to users within the same dial plan</strong>&nbsp;setting is enabled by default. You can enable this setting in an environment where not all users have been UM-enabled. This setting is also useful when you want to allow users who call in to a telephone number configured on an auto attendant to call extension numbers not associated with a UM-enabled user.</p>

By default, there are no in-country/region dialing rule groups configured on UM auto attendants. In-country/region dialing rule groups are used to allow or restrict the telephone numbers within a country or region that any user who has dialed in to the UM auto attendant can dial. This helps prevent unnecessary or unauthorized telephone calls and charges. To add in-country/region dialing rule groups, you must first create the appropriate in-country/region dialing rule groups on the dial plan associated with the UM auto attendant, and then add the appropriate dialing rule entries on the dialing rule group. After you create the required dialing rule groups on the dial plan, you must then add the dialing rule groups to the list of dialing restrictions on the&nbsp;<strong>Dialing Restrictions</strong>&nbsp;tab on the UM auto attendant. In-country/region dialing rule groups can be used to enable a Unified Messaging server to allow or restrict access to telephone numbers within a country or region. This is applied to any user who has called in to an auto attendant.</p>
