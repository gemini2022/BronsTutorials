Users aren't prompted for their account names and passwords. Instead, the server negotiates with the Windows security packages installed on the client computer. Integrated Windows authentication enables the server to authenticate users without prompting them for information and without transmitting information that isn't encrypted over the network. For this method to work, the client computer must be a member of the same domain as the servers running Exchange, or of a domain that's trusted by the domain that the Exchange server is in.</li>
