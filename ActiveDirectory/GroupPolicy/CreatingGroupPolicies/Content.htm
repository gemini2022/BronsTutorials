                  <li>The next option prevents the user from changing the password. Usually this option is selected when creating a shared account. For example, an account that may be used to access an internet kiosk used by many users. You don't want one user changing the password and preventing other users from using the kiosk later on. Also this option is sometimes used for a service account, or for an account used to run a particular application. If the password for this account was to change, especially if the account was used on multiple computers, this would prevent the application or service from running. Therefore, keeping this option un-checked for those reasons is a good idea.</li>

This option is normally selected when creating service accounts. Service accounts are often created to run applicaions like Exchange. If the password for the service account were to expire, and it was being used to run software, such as Exchange, all the Exchange servers using the account would stop running, and no one would be able to access their email. You can see why this option if often selected for service accounts.</li>
