                  <li>Or the <strong>'BOOTP'</strong> option. BOOTP is a networking protocol used to by a client for obtaining an IP address from a server. It is used to establish a network connection during a computer's initial boot up during the bootstrap process. Originally, the protocol used floppy disks, but it was soon integrated into computer hardware in motherboards and network adapters, so that no external drive was needed. BOOTP was intended for diskless systems because they require such a protocol in order to contact a server to obtain a network address and some information on which operating system to use. The computer would then download the OS via Trivial File Transfer Protocol. BOOTP was largely replaced by the more efficient Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which has more options and flexibility. However, it has found renewed utility in diskless media center PCs.</li>

                  <li>Starting with Windows Server 2008 R2, the DHCP Server service now includes an IPv4 scope setting named <strong>'Delay Configuration'</strong>. The Delay Configuration setting allows a DHCP administrator to delay the response from a DHCP server, to ensure that the desired primary DHCP server answers all DHCP lease requests, unless it is out of service. With this new setting alone, DHCP administrators can simplify the management of a split-scope DHCP configuration; as during normal operation, all leases should be only on the primary server. The Delay Configuration setting should be set up on secondary DHCP server scope properties. Type in the number of milliseconds the DHCP server should wait before responding to a client lease request.</li>
