                <td width="100%" align="left" valign="top">A Start of Authority (SOA) resource record indicates which domain name server (DNS) is the best source of information for the specified domain. Every domain must have an SOA record. An SOA Record is the most essential part of a Zone file. The SOA record is a way for the Domain Administrator to give out simple information about the domain like, how often it is updated, when it was last updated, when to check back for more info, what is the admins email address and so on. A Zone file can contain only one SOA Record. The SOA record refers to a DNS zone instead of a domain. The zone is simply the portion of a domain that is controlled by a particular server. One server can control many domains, but the SOA helps to establish the primary server for the individual zone, thus helping to point toward the correct working operator for that zone. Without this protocol, it would be much harder to collect and use the information that resides in the SOA.</td>

                <td width="100%" align="left" valign="top"><ul>
                  <li>In this field, a serial number of the zone file that is incremented each time a change is made is displayed.  The secondary name servers compares the serial number returned by the primary name server with the serial number in their copy of the zone file to determine if they should update their zone file.  If the serial number from the primary name server is greater than their serial number, they will do a zone update transfer.  Otherwise, no action is taken. If you make a change to the zone file on the primary name server and forget to increment the serial number, the change will not be propagated to the secondary name servers even if you attempt to force a zone update transfer.  The primary and secondary name servers will remain out of sync until the serial number is incremented on the primary name server.  Unless you are manually editing the zone files (something that is not uncommon when using BIND), most DNS servers or frontend DNS applications will increment the serial number for you.  But if you find that updates are not being propagated to the secondary name servers, the serial number is the first thing you should check. In the early days of DNS, the serial number was just that &mdash; a number that was incremented by 1 each time the zone file was changed.  So that one could have a better idea of when the zone file was actually changed, it's recommended (but not required) that you use the format YYYYMMDDnn, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day, and nn is the revision number (in case the zone file is changed more than once in a single day). Never use a decimal in the serial number, such as 20130511.01, even if it is allowed by your DNS server.  The serial number is an unsigned 32-bit number, so using a decimal in the serial number will cause it be converted to something unexpected.</li>

All secondary name servers create their zone files by transferring the contents from the primary name server.  Changes to the domain's resource records are made to the primary name server's zone file and are then propagated to the secondary name servers when they check for updates.

                  <li>In this field, an email address of the person responsible for the domain's zone file is displayed.  Often it will be an alias or group address rather than a particular idividual.  It uses a special format where the &quot;@&quot; character is replaced with a &quot;.&quot; (period) character and the email address ends with a period.  So the email address hostmaster@example.com would become hostmaster.example.com. (note that the endding period is part of the email address). Never use an email address which uses a period before the &quot;@&quot; character (such as host.master@example.com) since DNS will automatically interpret the first period as the &quot;@&quot; character (where host.master.example.com. would become host@master.example.com).</li>

                  <li>In this field is the time a secondary name server should wait between zone file update checks.  The value should not be so short that the primary name server is overwhelmed by update checks and not so long that propagation of changes to the secondary name servers are unduely delayed.  If you control the secondary name servers and the zone file doesn't change that often, then you might want to set this to as long as day, especially if you can force an update on the secondary name servers if needed.  But if your secondary name servers are not under your control, then you'll probably want to set this to somewhere between 30 minutes and 2 hours to ensure any changes you make are propagated in a timely fashion. Even if you configure your primary name server to send NOTIFY messages  to the secondary name servers whenever a change is made, you should never completely depend on this to ensure timely propagation of the changes, especially when using third-party secondary name servers. The decision to honor a NOTIFY message is entirely up to the secondary name server and some DNS servers do not support NOTIFY.</li>

                  <li>In this field is the time that a secondary name server should wait before trying to contact the primary name server again after a failed attempt to check for a zone file update.  There are all kinds of reasons why a zone file update check could fail, and not all of them mean that there is something wrong with the primary name server.  Perhaps it was too busy handling other requests just then.  The Retry Interval simply tells the secondary name server to wait for a period of time before trying again.  A good retry value would be between 10 minutes and 1 hour, depending on the length of the Refresh Interval. The retry interval should always be shorter than the refresh interval.  But don't make this value too short.  When in doubt, use a 10 minute  retry interval.</li>

If your primary name server goes offline for some reason, you want the secondary name names to keep answering DNS queries for your domain until you can get the primary back online.  Make this value too short and your domain will disapear from the Internet before you can bring the primary back online.  A good value would be something between 1 day and 2 days. If you stop using a domain and delete it from the configuration of the primary name server, remember to remove it from the secondary name servers as well.  This is especially important if you use third-party secondary name servers since they will continue to answer queries for the deleted domain &mdash; answers which could now be completely incorrect &mdash; until the expiry interval is reached.</li></ul></td>
