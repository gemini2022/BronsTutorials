                    <li><strong>Client passes all SHV checks</strong>. Use this setting to create a health policy that requires a client computer to meet the requirements of all enabled SHVs. This is the most restrictive setting that you can use to evaluate compliant computers.&nbsp;</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Client fails all SHV checks</strong>. Use this setting to create a health policy that requires a client computer to fail to meet requirements of all enabled SHVs. This is the least restrictive setting that you can use to evaluate noncompliant computers.&nbsp;</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Client passes one or more SHV checks</strong>. Use this setting to create a health policy that requires a client computer to meet the requirements of at least one enabled SHV. This is the least restrictive setting that you can use to evaluate compliant computers.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Client fails one or more SHV checks</strong>. Use this setting to create a health policy that requires a client computer to fail to meet requirements of at least one enabled SHV. This is the most restrictive setting that you can use to evaluate noncompliant computers.</li>
                  	<br>
                    <li><strong>Client reported as transitional by one or more SHVs</strong>. Use this setting to create a health policy for clients that report a status of transitional in extended state information. To use this setting, the SHV must support extended state reporting as part of the health evaluation process. A transitional state indicates that required services on the client are not ready to report health status. The transitional state can be temporary. For example, a client might report a status of transitional if services have been recently started.&nbsp;</li>
                  	<br>
                    <li><strong>Client reported as infected by one or more SHVs</strong>. Use this setting to create a health policy for clients that report a status of infected in extended state information. To use this setting, the SHV must support extended state reporting as part of the health evaluation process. This extended state information is used primarily by an antivirus SHA that is capable of reporting that the client is infected with malicious software (also called malware) that it cannot remove.</li>
                  	<br>
                    <li><strong>Client reported as unknown by one or more SHVs</strong>. Use this setting to create a health policy for clients that report a status of unknown in extended state information. To use this setting, the SHV must support extended state reporting as part of the health evaluation process. An unknown state indicates that the credentials of the end host cannot be determined. The unknown state can be temporary.</li>
