By default, a record of each request and issued certificate is stored in the CA database. A high volume of requests increases the CA database growth rate and administration cost. The&nbsp;<strong>'Do not store certificates and requests in the CA database'</strong>&nbsp;option configures the template so that the CA processes certificate requests without adding records to the CA database.</p>
